## Hi I'm Nhat 👋

I’m currently a software developer exploring AI development and backend engineering.  
* 🔬 I’m working on **AI products**: currently developing computer vision applications using **OpenCV (cv2)**, **Mediapipe (facial mesh)** to draw and calculate **facial feature metrics** for assessment.  
* 🦷 I’m part of a **research team** exploring **AI applications in dentistry**.  
* 🤖 On the side, my team builds **chatbots** and **webapps**, and we support technical parts for **non-technical users** (mainly medical professionals such as dentistry students and professors). I also create **Python automation tools** to simplify and streamline repetitive workflows for them.  
* 🌐 I’m seeking a **Front End developer (web/app)** for collaboration, since my expertise focuses on API and backend design.
